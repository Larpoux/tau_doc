The example source [is there](https://github.com/canardoux/flutter_sound/blob/master/example/lib/player_onProgress/player_on_progress.dart)

This example shows how to use the verb `setSubscriptionDuration()` on a player for having an `onProgress()` callback.
There is a slider to show are the playback frequency can be adjust.

This example is really basic.
